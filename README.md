## Disclaimer

Im a beginner at programming.

This code / codesnipet is a result of my learning process and most likely
not the correct, neither the most elegant way of doing it.
I'm aware of this and therefor you should too!

Which doesn't mean feedback isn't welcome - quite the contrary,
it would help me out a lot and is highly appreciated.

I strongly believe that the internet thrives of user participation,
hence I'm hoping that somebody might find this useful / helpful. 

Kind regards, Niklas
